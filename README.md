# Twilio Serverless JWT Callback

This is just a simple Twilio Serverless Function to demonstrate authenticating callbacks/webhooks to Google Sheets

This uses the [Twilio CLI](https://www.twilio.com/docs/twilio-cli/quickstart) with the [Twilio Serverless Plugin](https://www.twilio.com/docs/twilio-cli/plugins)

## Installation

1.  Create a new Twilio Servless Project using the Twilio CLI

    ```zsh
    twilio serverless:init <name>
    ```

2.  You can remove all example functions/files from the assets and functions folders

3.  Copy the _google_callback.js_ function to the functions folder

4.  Copy the _package.json_ file into the root directory

5.  Copy the key from Google Step 2 (below) into the assets folder of your function (rename to key.private.json)

6.  Deploy the Serverless Function using Twilio CLI

    ```zsh
    twilio serverless:deploy
    ```

6b. Once deployed, visit your [Twilio Console](https://www.twilio.com/console/functions/overview/services) click on the service link and grab the URL for the Function and path - `https://jwt-callback-NNNN-dev.twil.io/google_callback`

7.  Alternatively, you can run this locally for testing. See [Developing with the Serverless Toolkit](https://www.twilio.com/docs/labs/serverless-toolkit/developing?code-sample=code-run-a-serverless-project-locally&code-language=twilio-cli&code-sdk-version=default)

## Basics for Google Auth Key

_(Google changes their IAM console regularly, so keeping this relatively generic)_

    1. Create a service account: https://console.developers.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts/
    2. In options, create a key: this key client_secret.json
    3. Make the role owner for the service account
        - Member name = service account ID = service account email ex: someapp@appname-201813.iam.gserviceaccount.com
    4. Copy the email address of your service account = service account ID
    5. Simply go in your browser to the Google sheet you want to interact with
    6. Go to SHARE on the top right of your screen
    7. Go to advanced settings and share it with email address of your service account
        - ex: someapp@appname-201813.iam.gserviceaccount.com
